# Indian Crime Data Analysis with SQL

This project explores patterns and trends in crime data reported across major Indian cities using **SQL Server (T-SQL)**. The dataset includes incident-level records from 2020 to 2024, detailing crime types, locations, times, victim profiles, and police response.
